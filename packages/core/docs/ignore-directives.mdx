# Ignore Directives

PromptShield supports ignore directives to suppress specific detections.

This allows developers to acknowledge and intentionally allow content that would otherwise be flagged.

---

## Syntax

A line can be ignored using:

```text
promptshield-ignore
```

Example:

```md
<!-- promptshield-ignore -->

Ignores threats on this line
```

The directive applies to the next line.

---

## Why ignore directives exist

Some content is intentionally allowed, such as:

- documentation examples
- test fixtures
- security research content
- encoded data samples
- educational material

Ignore directives allow these cases without disabling the scanner.

---

## Security considerations

Ignore directives can introduce risk if used improperly.

Attackers may attempt to include ignore directives inside user-generated content.

Because of this, PromptShield provides configuration to disable ignore handling.

---

## Disabling ignore directives

Ignore directives can be disabled using:

```

allowIgnoreDirectives: false

```

When disabled:

- ignore directives are ignored
- threats are still reported
- suppression does not occur

This is recommended for:

- CI environments
- production scanning
- server-side validation
- prompt ingestion pipelines

---

## Visible suppression

PromptShield does not silently suppress threats.

When a directive suppresses detection, the scanner may report:

```

Threat suppressed by promptshield-ignore directive

```

This ensures visibility and auditability.

---

## Recommended usage

Use ignore directives sparingly and only in:

- trusted code
- test files
- documentation examples

Avoid using ignore directives in:

- user content
- prompt templates
- production prompts

---

## Mental model

Ignore directives are similar to:

```

eslint-disable
ts-ignore

```

They are an escape hatch, not a default workflow.

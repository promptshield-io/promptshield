# Homoglyph Detection

PromptShield detects **mixed-script homoglyph attacks**, where visually
similar characters from different Unicode scripts are combined to create
deceptive identifiers or instructions.

These attacks are commonly used in:

- prompt injection
- identity spoofing
- configuration manipulation
- phishing-style prompt attacks
- code review bypass

---

## Why this matters

Humans read **glyphs visually**.

Computers interpret **Unicode code points**.

Two characters that look identical can be completely different:

```

a (Latin)     U+0061
а (Cyrillic)  U+0430

```

This enables spoofing like:

```

admin
admіn   ← Cyrillic "і"

```

They look identical in most editors.

They are not the same string.

This breaks validation, allow-lists, and policy checks.

---

## Detection model

The PromptShield homoglyph detector:

- scans text for word spans
- inspects Unicode script composition per word
- detects suspicious **Latin + Cyrillic** or **Latin + Greek** mixing
- emits **one diagnostic per word**

The detector intentionally avoids flagging multilingual text to reduce
false positives.

---

## Rule

---

### PSH001

> Mixed-script homoglyph word

Severity: CRITICAL

A word contains characters from multiple Unicode scripts that can be used
for spoofing.

Example:

```

pаypal

```

The second character is Cyrillic:

```

p + Cyrillic "а" + ypal

```

Another example:

```

admіn

```

Where:

```

i → Cyrillic "і"

```

These words appear normal to humans but differ at the code-point level.

---

## Suggested remediation

Replace homoglyph characters with characters from the intended script.

For identifiers, prompts, and configuration values:

- use ASCII when possible
- avoid mixed-script identifiers
- normalize input before validation

---

## Design notes

PromptShield intentionally detects **mixed-script composition**, not
individual confusable characters.

This avoids false positives in:

- multilingual documentation
- international content
- natural language text

Detection focuses on **security-relevant misuse**, not typography.

---

## Mental model

Homoglyph detection protects against:

- identifier spoofing
- prompt impersonation
- policy bypass using confusable characters

It is conceptually similar to:

- IDN homograph protections in browsers
- Unicode spoofing detection
- authentication identifier validation
